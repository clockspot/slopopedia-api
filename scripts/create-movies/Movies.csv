The Ice Pirates,,1980s,"Brought to you by the director of Tammy and the T-Rex and Mac and Me.

John Carradine! Anjelica Huston! Ron Perlman!!

Raffill says the film ""ended up being a fiasco... MGM went through a transition and they brought in a new guy, who was eventually found out to be stealing money from the company. He was a little problematic sort of a fellow. And he had a bad time with John Foreman so he tried to sabotage the film. Pulled the money out on them, but we did finish it."" Raffill says ""Turns out the producer was a close friend of Paul Newman's and the studio head had said something derogatory about Paul Newman's wife and so the producer had punched him! ... At the end of the film, they were meant to arrive at Earth and they fly over the beaches of Malibu with everyone swimming in the water and the studio head cut that out! He never told me and it was gone. I had to drink vodka to calm myself down.""

Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot,,1990s,"Smarting from a romantic breakup, macho police Sgt. Joe Bomowski (Sylvester Stallone) gets a cross-country visit from his mother, Tutti (Estelle Getty). Her misguided efforts to help only fray his nerves, but that doesn't stop her from nagging Joe to be more open about his feelings toward his ex-girlfriend and current boss, Lt. Gwen Harper (JoBeth Williams). When Tutti witnesses a brutal multiple murder, she takes her meddling to the extreme by tagging along to help her son solve the case. How could that not be fun?

Written by ten eight year olds in a trench coat. Someone was working through their trauma here but that didn’t need to involve all of us. There’s a couple of good jokes here!

Needed a higher Stallone to Getty ratio

I know people who couldn't believe “The Hand that Rocks the Cradle” because the nanny wasn't checked out first. Would a Nazi let an unknown person have the run of his house? There's lots of Nancy Drew stuff, as when Griffith discovers the secret room in the Nazi's basement by noticing there are two windows on one side but only one on the other, and there's a hilarious scene in which she flees, frightened, through the city streets in a red opera cloak and a flowing white dress, and of course we get the “friends” who turn out to be enemies (we can tell because their eyes harden), and the escape down the laundry chute, and the convenient plans for the entire Nazi rocket-bomb operation, which she microfilms.

Albert Pyun of The Sword and the Sorcerer, Cyborg and the Nemesis saga directs this … comedy film? I feel weirdly hopeful about this.

Hard to tell if this is intentional slop, but I'm leaning towards yes. It's got some Velocipastor vibes.

There's no way he didn't do that on purpose. Right?

There's gore, but only in a koolaid-in-a-supersoaker kind of way.

This is real cheap and silly. It has MST3K special effects budget. The theme music is clearly a John Williams riff, notably the Raiders March and was shot in Roger Corman’s studio in four days. The music is bad. It thinks its sexy but its about as sexy as a pickle bucket filled with pennies in the back of a cargo van.

The Astrologer,,1970s,"""The film begins by introducing us to Denney as “Craig Marcus Alexander,” who explains via voiceover that he was “born to lie, cheat and steal.” He does this by bilking people out of their money at carnival side shows as an astrologer/fortune teller, but after meeting the love of his life (played by Denney’s real-life cousin, who he repeatedly makes out with), he aims for bigger things by joining a diamond smuggling operation, which he agrees to over an idyllic picnic set in a cemetery. The film then demonstrates one of its first instant classic moments of WTF editing by smash-cutting in the middle of dialog to a prison camp in Africa, where a shirtless Alexander is held prisoner, his diamond mission apparently having gone poorly.""

I have seen mere clips of this movie and am, correctly, baffled. But also intrigued???

edit: this is the strangest movie I have ever seen. It was never released, in part, because he just used a bunch of unlicensed Moody Blues songs and like, didn't think it would be a problem. You have to see this. there's quicksand.

Highlight: the movie is trying to show that Chuck Norris is driving through a BAD neighborhood, but it has a really hazy idea of what that would be, so in the space of three blocks, he drives by black people who yell at his car, a white biker gang who attacks his car with chains, and a man busking with a baritone saxophone next to a barrel fire.

A scientist named Kazuko Izumi and two young children, Jiro Sakaki and Yurika, mistakenly travel through time to a future, where the planet Earth is now ruled by bad actors who wear non-moving ape masks. The trio struggle to find a way to get back home to the 20th century, with the help of one surviving human, Godo, and his little ape friend, Pepe.

Bad Boys,,1990s,"Michael Bay's first movie is raw, uncut, kinda-boring Bayhem. 

Every shot is *interesting*, which is as exhausting as it is in later Bay movies, but less stylistically cohesive. Men yell at each other, either because of gay panic or because everyone is hateful. All non-white people are viewed from a white gaze. 

But the weird thing is how much of the movie is, like, a bad screwball comedy, where the married (sexually-frustrated) Martin Lawrence character has to assume the identity of his single, inexplicably rich partner (Will Smith) in order to hold onto a witness (a woman who is definitely not a prostitute who is a replacement witness for the sex worker who was the witness until she was gunned down in front of her).

Ghost,,1990s,"i know this was the top grossing film of 1990 and made Demi Moore a bankable star, but what i remember most besides the pottery is Whoopi Goldberg playing a straight up con-artist who “accidentally” is able to talk with dead people named Oda Mae Brown. pretty sure there’s loads of casual racism in this. update: this film is basically casual racism the movie ☹️☹️

also Swayze landed the role after he felt his prior two films (road house and next of kin) were too beefy and macho.

Becca: Look, everyone here is acting their hearts out and it’s clear that the production team thought they had a tearjerking classic on their hands. Marvel as increasingly unlikeable Sam Wheat carves a path of destruction through his old life and the life of unwitting psychic sidekick Oda Mae Brown. Gag as the film routinely sidesteps any and all characterization of non-white characters except for Oda, whom Sam bullies into assisting his quest for ghost vengeance by keeping her awake all night singing, Guantanamo-style, forcing her to make herself look like a crazy person in front of his rich wife and former coworkers, teases her with the prospect of four million dollars, sends a murderer to scare the hell out of her and her sisters, wrecks the shit out of her apartment and then literally uses her body to make out with his wife one last time before getting her injured in an attempt to escape the murderer.

In near-future 2008, Los Angeles (referred to as ""The Southland"" by locals) is a city on the brink of chaos overshadowed by the growth of an underground neo-Marxist organization.

The Taverner twins are revealed to be the same person by the engineers of Treer, duplicated when Roland traveled through a rift in space-time, while Boxer has become the most wanted man in the world despite his political ties and his having the fate of the future, in the form of a prophetic screenplay foretelling the end of the world, in his hands.",0,s3.amazonaws.com/appforest_uf/f1589717698398x765989166119719300/EagerBlueLacewing-size_restricted.gif,"I Should Fire My Agent , I Wonder If That’s the Bad Guy , Sincere , That One Actor is Really Trying , This Movie Loves Women , Unexpectedly Garbage Cameo , Wake Up Sheeple , Wow So Sexy , Unexpectedly Grim",2006,160,Southland Tales,39,"May 17, 2020 8:15 AM","Sep 14, 2020 7:02 PM",etartane@gmail.com,1589717699493x300244492054691840

Johnny meets a priest named Moreau (Idris Elba), who asks Johnny to find a boy named Danny (Fergus Riordan) and bring him back. But there's a catch -- Satan (Ciarán Hinds) is looking for the boy too, and has a personal stake in the matter. But if Johnny can find Danny first and save the boy's soul, there's a chance Johnny can save his own soul as well.


God damn this sounds sloppy. Since when was the ghost rider the devil's bounty hunter?

Billy Zane is here and he’s not really bothering. The bad guy spends a lot of the movie issuing inscrutable bad guy orders from a hospital bed.

MJ: This prequel, set 100 years before the events of the first film, seems to be centered around someone saying “what if we did Tremors in the wild west?” While slow and casually racist, the film does return to the real practical effects of the first film. Unfortunately, the series is great because of Bert Grummer and his doomsday prepped knowledge set of survivalism. This film robs the audience of that very luxury, reducing him to “prim east coast dandy.” He spends the first two thirds of the film literally riding bikes and holding horses for others, namely Billy Drago’s slick outlaw.

It's up to Burt, Jack Sawyer (Matthew Seth Wilson) and other locals to save their town from destruction.

Chris: This second sequel is meh, returning to Perfection to witness the town struggling to balance being a real town of 14 people and a tourist attraction for yahoos from Bixby or Carson City. This film introduces a second evolution, aptly named the Ass-Blasters, flying and farting killers.

Tremors 2: Aftershocks,Netflix,1990s,"The guy who isn't Kevin Bacon in the first film goes mercenary on those worms' butts. But what's this? They've evolved!?!

This movie cost less than After Last Season.

MJ: The best of the series, and let me explain why. There’s no Kevin Bacon (plus), Fred Ward’s character is old and sad (plus), and the originally subterranean Graboids have begun evolving into Shriekers, who are blind, terrestrial, hermaphroditic hunters. While the Kevin Bacon replacement character is actually the worst, the December - December romance between Ward and Helen Shaver’s scientist is fucking delightful. It’s not the type of romance that films often explore, and it is totally believable given all the setup about how old and lonely Ward has become. The movie never stops delivering, from RC cars loaded with dynamite to Gummer’s gun that literally shoots through everything.

Conan the Barbarian,,1980s,"AHHH NOLD. 

Conan the barbarian is a sword and sandal character and set of stories created in 1932. 

In 1978 Paramount Studios invested 2.5 million dollars into a project, a movie to be written in a cocaine and antidepressant haze by Oliver Stone. 

It was then directed by the guy who John Goodman’s character from The Big Lebowski is based on, who promptly rewrote it. A super macho right wing conservative who had not received credit for writing Dirty Harry and Magnum Force

It’s mostly just hero shots of Arnold walking across deserts with music playing, inter spliced with Room-style sex/what Tommy Wiseau imagines intimacy to be scenes. So many tits. 

And then’s there the whole case of the act three snake cult of KKK members following James Earl Jones? What?

Arnold is beautiful, except when he’s goddamned crucified, and then kills a bird with his fucking teeth while being crucified. The world is crazy.

Final Flesh,,2000s,"A series of non sequitur vignettes set after a nuclear apocalypse. The script was sent to four different bespoke porn production companies, each of whom didn't know there were three other parts to the film or that the whole piece was ultimately an exercise in surrealist satire.

I really wanted to like this based on the premise, but unfortunately the result is a missed opportunity that isn’t for anyone. Whoever made this got too carried away in the power trip of making the actors do and say all the lol-so-random shit he wanted, so even though the result isn’t strictly porn, it’s still represents a simple adolescent fantasy. It doesn’t matter whether the actors and production companies were aware of the auteur’s intent or not. It’s their job to do whatever weird shit the client pays them to do. No subversion of the medium here. A wiser auteur would have sent the production companies four pieces of The Bald Soprano and insisted on no nudity. Now that I’d enjoy.

Cool Word is so broadly hateful that ""Cool World"" now serves to describe any movie that makes you feel physically ill from the amount of disdain it has for the humanity of the viewer. It's like an unwashed duvet cover at a cheap motel.

According to someone on the internet, Cool World started out as an erotic horror film before Kim Basinger came on board and told the producer she wanted to be able to show it to her kids.
