"Oscar Wilde, in one of his more soulful moods, said that there are as many types of perfection as there are imperfect men. But a movie, unlike a man, exists for a reason. With a little expertise and organization, people can come together to make the same kind of imperfect movie over and over again.  The great works of slop, like all great monstrosities, are unprecedented in nature. That makes it a hard category to define. Maybe one way to understand slop would be to contrast it with those redundant movies that are flawless without being perfect. Given enough time and light, there could be an infinite number of uniquely good and bad movies, but there would always be a single black hole where the merely competent ones trace the same outlines until they undershadow each other.

I saw My Best Friend’s Wedding less than twenty-four hours ago, and I can already feel it fading out of my memory. It was more like an example of a movie than a movie, and now it’s almost nothing at all. Julia Roberts plays a career-focused food writer who has always warded off romantic intimacy, but desperately tries to break-up her best friend's engagement to a twenty-year-old college student (Cameron Diaz) because she wants him all to herself. She fails in her quest, but her gay best friend (Rupert Everett) flies across the country so she has someone to dance with at the wedding. You’ve seen the last line of the movie on Tinder profiles. 

When talented people serve a formula, the best moments can stir up your admiration for movie-making, without making you like the movie. There’s a scene where Roberts is sitting in the hall of a hotel, sadly smoking a cigarette after confessing to a reprehensible act of deception. When an employee, played by a baby-faced Paul Giamatti, comes to tell her that the whole floor is nonsmoking, she apologizes but offers him a puff before he goes on his way. He accepts, and they smoke a little, face to face. This moment, with that specifically nineties attitude towards cigarettes, expresses the hope that we can still be worthy of forbearance and intimacy after we feel like we’ve ruined everything. It isn’t integral to the movie, but it’s my favorite use of actors and cameras in the whole thing.

The best scenes in a grossly competent movie may not rise above the work that they’re in, but at least they can sink into their historical moment. About halfway through the movie, Roberts tries to sabotage her best-friend’s fiancé by taking the couple to a karaoke bar, knowing that his child bride is a terrible singer. When Roberts forces her to sing a song, Diaz does her best—miserable, but resolute—as the heckling crowd is slowly won over and ends up cheering her. Everything about this scene feels false, but it works cinematically. You can’t really believe that this would be how Roberts’s character would try to undermine her friend’s affection for this young woman, but she sells it in the long takes. As the crowd is learning to love Diaz, Roberts can convey the suppressed dread that her plan is failing, which is also the dread at no longer being preferred—and that’s one of the fears that cameras are made to explore. Even though you can’t really believe any karaoke bar would be set up like this or any crowd would change its opinion in such a unified voice, maybe that’s all for the better. The scene feels like a person who has never done karaoke projecting their desires and fears onto it—just right for 1997. 

It's from a time when movies were still one of the primary ways in which adults processed contemporary life. I could imagine what it would be like to be a middle-aged person back then and feel like this was worth the eight-dollar ticket to see movie stars fondly remember an old pop song, nod at our anxieties, wear the new clothes, say what people were just recently saying. The pleasure of competency has a strange way of obviating the movies where we find it. I think that one feature of slop, at least good slop, is an overwhelming thisness that so often comes when there's a breach of competence or when a premise is so absurd that it's making competence work at cross-purposes.",,Published,Not Slop,Merely Competent Movies,"May 5, 2022 9:27 pm","May 5, 2022 9:27 pm",sean.chris.hughes@gmail.com,1651800438352x523035812368220160
